					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>There was no challenge for this Lab 4. Mostly confused about where to put our outline and our mini-game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>Dylan and I solved these problems by asking each other questions, referencing our work with each other, and rereading the instructions once more.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment?</p>
					<p>Lab 4 was fairly simple to understand and we were able to finish it within a few hours. We got detailed with the pseudocode mini-game and changing the CSS to our own personal styles, so I believe that showed the energy we put into this Lab.</p>
